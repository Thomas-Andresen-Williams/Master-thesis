# Master-thesis
This repo contains some of the code work I did during my master thesis. 

Most of this code is exploratory, meaning that it was not used in the thesis, and some strange structure might therefore occur.

The purpse of this thesis was to used physics based and machine learning based methods to determine the hole cleaning conditions af a wellbore during drilling operation.
Hole cleaning refers to the transport of rock debris (cuttings) that is made during drilling.

A more detailed descriptions of the different notebooks might come later. The purpose of this repo is mainly to make sure that the code is available for me, but it is made public so that others might examine my work.
